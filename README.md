# Homing-Projectile-Motion
3D projectile motion with moving target tracking support.

To use this code,
1. Add both files to solution and generate project files.
2. Create an object of HomingProjectileMotion and Setup HPM.
3. Update HPM per frame where its output will give required velocity to have homing projectile.

Feel free to make changes as per your project requirements.
